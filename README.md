Disclaimer! <br><br>

This "Encryption" and "Decryption" Tool is baised on the .DEC files from HackNet - It's not a save way to store important files. <br>
It's has been made for fun and should only be used for fun and not legitimate encryption.<br>
It will be kept in a Bash like function wise state, meaning no GUI or anything like that. <br><br>

Disclamer End. <br><br>
