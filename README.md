<h1>DECryptSuite from HackNet</h1>
<p size="16">
Disclaimer! <br><br>

This "Encryption" and "Decryption" Tool is based on .DEC files from Hacknet - It's not a safe way to store important files. <br>
It's has been made for fun and should only be used for fun and not legitimate encryption.<br>
It will be kept in a Bash like state, meaning no GUI or anything. <br><br>

Disclaimer end. <br><br>
